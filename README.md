# NFT MARKETPLACE ( Student Community )

> **Abstract** : It is quite clear that blockchain technology and NFTs can offer the perfect opportunity for artists and content creators to obtain financial remuneration for their works. Now, artists donâ€™t have to depend anymore on auction houses or galleries for selling their artwork. On the contrary, an artist could just sell their work to a buyer in the form of NFT. The marketplace allows people to buy sell and trade NFT art.
